## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I was responsible for devising a solution enabling the pirate to navigate their way to the treasure successfully. My task involved meticulously mapping out all potential routes while ensuring the pirate followed the most optimal path to the coveted loot. My code encompassed the crucial logic governing the pirate's movements throughout the journey. It is worth noting that I was provided with the pirate's initial location to initiate the exploration.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are professionals who study and apply the principles of computation and information processing. They develop algorithms, design software, and hardware systems, analyze data, and solve complex problems using computational techniques. Computer scientists work in various domains, including software development, artificial intelligence, data science, cybersecurity, networking, and more.

The work of computer scientists is essential because it drives innovation and technological advancements. They contribute to the development of new software applications, improve system performance, create efficient algorithms for processing large amounts of data, enhance cybersecurity measures, and design intelligent systems that can make decisions and learn from data. Computer scientists play a crucial role in shaping the future by creating and improving the tools and technologies that impact our daily lives.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, it is crucial to follow a systematic and analytical approach. In most cases, this entails several key steps. First, considering the domain and constraints involved, one must thoroughly understand the problem and its requirements. Next, the problem is decomposed into smaller, more manageable subproblems, identifying the key components and their relationships. Then, algorithms or strategies are designed to solve these subproblems, considering factors such as efficiency, correctness, and scalability. The next step is implementing the designed algorithms by writing code or developing software using appropriate programming languages and tools. Once implemented, the solution is tested and evaluated to validate its performance against the problem requirements, iterating and refining as necessary. Finally, the solution is documented and effectively communicated to stakeholders, including code documentation, user manuals, and technical reports. By following this systematic approach, computer scientists can effectively tackle problems, develop efficient solutions, and communicate their findings to others.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethical responsibilities are paramount for computer scientists. They have a responsibility to consider the potential impact of their work on end-users and society as a whole. Computer scientists should prioritize user privacy, security, and accessibility while avoiding biases and discrimination. They should adhere to ethical guidelines, ensure informed consent, and be transparent about their systems' limitations and potential risks. Additionally, they should be mindful of the societal implications of their work, such as the effects on employment, fairness, and the environment.

## Summary 

Computer scientists apply computational principles to solve complex problems, drive innovation, and develop technologies that shape our world. They approach problems systematically, design efficient algorithms, implement software solutions, and consider ethical responsibilities towards end-users and society.
